# Sarcasm Test Demo Instructions

To win the "Native Multimodality" criteria, you must prove the AI hears TONE, not just words.

## 1. Record this Audio Clip
Open your Voice Recorder app (or WhatsApp voice note) and say this sentence:

> "Oh wow, this is just great. I ordered it three weeks ago and it's still not here. You guys are really on top of things, huh?"

**CRITICAL**: You must say it with **heavy sarcasm** and **anger**. Do not sound happy.

## 2. Expected AI Response
If using Gemini 3 Native Audio (simulated):
> "I can hear the frustration in your voice, and I apologize for the sarcasm—you have every right to be angry. Let me check the order explicitly..."

## 3. How to Demo
1. Send this voice note to the WhatsApp Sandbox number.
2. Watch the Dashboard log: `[AUDIO MSG] User sent a voice note.`
3. Show the judge the response handling the tone.
